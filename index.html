            <p>I am currently enrolled in an Ohio State University coding boot camp while I hold a day job as a Senior Technical Manager at Chuck E. Cheese.  I troubleshoot and repair arcade machine, an animatronic show and many other restaurant equipment. I joined the bootcamp to move my education from computer hardware to software. I love learning new things and cannot wait to join a company and use all my background to develope new and exciting web pages. </p>
